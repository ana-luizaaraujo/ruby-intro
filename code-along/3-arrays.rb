# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]


# Accessing the array
# puts foods [0]

# Add to the array
shopping_list = foods + ["eggs"]
foods.push "eggs"
puts shopping_list

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
